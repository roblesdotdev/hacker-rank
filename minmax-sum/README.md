## Min Max Sum

Given five positive integers, find the minimum and maximum values that can be
calculated by summing exactly four of the five integers. Then print the respective
minimum and maximum values as a single line of two space-separated long integers.

```
arr = [1, 3, 5, 7, 9]  -> array of 5 integer

minSum = 1 + 3 + 5 + 7
maxSum = 3 + 5 + 7 + 9

output:

16 24   -> min and max sum of 4 of 5 elements
```
