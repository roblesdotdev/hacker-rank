## Plus Minus

Given an array of integers, calculate the ratios of its elements that are positive,
negative, and zero. Print the decimal value of each fraction on a new line with  
places after the decimal.

```
arr = [1, 1, 0, -1, -1]

size = 5

positives = 2
negatives = 2
zeroes = 1

posRatio = positives / size
negRatio = positive / size
zeroRatio = zeroes / size

Output:

0.400000
0.400000
0.200000
```
